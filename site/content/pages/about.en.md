Hi, I'm Nikita. I'm front-end developer from Russia, Moscow (i dream about moving to Helsinki). I'm working in [Mail.ru](https://mail.ru) and almost for two years I code Mediaprojects. Earlier I spent almost 6 years coding back-office in [Авто.ру](https://auto.ru) and different parts of main site.

In my spare time I do some freelance, learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and code secret project. All other time I spend with my [Volvo](https://www.drive2.ru/r/volvo/v40_cross_country/480505823865339906/) or playing Overwatch, Gwent or Diablo 3.
